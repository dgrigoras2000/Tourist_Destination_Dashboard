So far, I'm in the midst of working on two small projects aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of project flow from inception to customer reception. These projects have provided valuable opportunities for me to familiarize myself with essential tools like SVN and coding.
Everything has gone well so far, including progress on the two projects. Additionally, my relationships with colleagues and new project members have been positive, and I find the working environment very friendly.

I've learned how the project progresses and evolves, witnessing collaboration among different team members to resolve issues. Additionally, I've gained proficiency in utilizing the tools provided, including SVN.
Next, I plan to deepen my understanding of new technologies and tools within our projects. I am committed to giving my best to effectively resolve any challenges that may arise.
